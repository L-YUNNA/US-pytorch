## Overview

This project focuses on classifying tumors in ultrasound images through a two-stage pipeline: **Upstream** and **Downstream** tasks.

## ðŸ§© Upstream Task

The upstream task involves self-supervised learning (SSL) using approximately 60,000 ultrasound images from publicly available datasets to pretrain models. Two different SSL approaches were employed:

- **DINOv1** using ResNet-50 as the backbone.
- **MAE (Masked Autoencoder)** using ViT-B/16 as the backbone.

These pretrained weights and associated training code can be found at the links below:

**Datasets used in upstream training**:

| **Thyroid** | DDTI *(Thyroid ultrasound images)* ([link](#))                                           | Segmentation of the thyroid nodules                 | 480 images                         |

> âœ… Total: More than 60,000 ultrasound images secured.

## ðŸ“Œ Downstream Task

The downstream task focuses on tumor classification by transferring the pretrained weights from the upstream phase. Two models are used:

- A CNN-based classifier using **ResNet-50**
- A transformer-based classifier using **ViT-B/16**

The implementation for the downstream classification task is available in the repository:
